1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7?!

7. You read that correctly. That's the start to a real integer sequence, the powers of primes. Want something easier? How about the next number in 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55? If you answered 89, you may enjoy this challenge. Your computer may find it considerably less enjoyable.

The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is a 50+ year effort by mathematicians the world over to catalog sequences of integers. If it has a pattern, it's probably in the OEIS, and probably described with amazing detail. This competition challenges you create a machine learning algorithm capable of guessing the next number in an integer sequence. While this sounds like pattern recognition in its most basic form, a quick look at the data will convince you this is anything but basic!
